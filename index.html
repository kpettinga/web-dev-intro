			When I was 18, I went to college to become a pilot. But eventually I decided that I would rather be a graphic designer. I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from Western Michigan University. After I graduated I moved to New York city <img src="https://api.mapbox.com/v4/kirkpettinga.nakj1ckn/-73.992,40.727,11/150x150.png?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoia2lya3BldHRpbmdhIiwiYSI6ImFXZTFFRUUifQ.K4Ia5hM1_o8Wogg3_rYovg" /> and began working as a graphic designer and within about 6 months I was hired at a company called <a href="http://www.objectivesubject.com" target="_blank">Objective Subject</a> who I still work for today.

			I haven't always done web development. At first I was only <em>designing</em> websites, not actually <strong>building</strong> them. Over time, however, I became interested in how websites were made and experimented with building them on my own. 5 years later, I am a full time web developer and I really love it!
